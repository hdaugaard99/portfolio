	<h1>Summary</h1>
	<div class="resume">
	<p>Born and raised in Kansas, I am a person who appreciates both small town, Midwestern values and the opportunity to work with and learn from people of all backgrounds.  I graduated from a high school of students from 30 different countries and 33 first languages.  The global perspective I learned from my community and family is a quality that I embrace and will continue to seek in my career and personal life.<br><br>

I have always been drawn to the arts.  I studied cello for nine years, and through the years I have enjoyed making music with my friends and family, as well as compiling my own mash-ups in my home studio.  I was fortunate to take three years of broadcast journalism classes during high school, and earning four Kansas Broadcasting Association awards encouraged me to briefly consider broadcasting as a college major.<br><br>

As one of my family’s go-to tech specialists, I always welcome the opportunity to work with new technology.  Although this has involved hours of teaching family members the ins and outs of their newest devices over the years, I have never tired of wanting to learn more. Eventually, I began learning coding on my own.  I enrolled in a coding class in high school and also took a photography and graphic design.  As I investigated college programs, I realized that web design is an area that fascinates me.  The opportunities in Fort Hays State University’s Informatics program impressed me, and so I have been working on my Bachelor’ degree in that field.  <br><br>

I will graduate from FHSU in December 2020, and I am excited to begin my career with a vibrant, forward-thinking company that shares my passions for celebrating diversity, tackling climate change by caring for our planet, and promoting educational opportunities for all.  I am willing to relocate to fulfill the needs of the job, although I would also consider a distance position.  My dog, Maya, and I are eager to begin our next chapter.<br><br>
